# Commit Workflow

Follow this sequence every time:

1. Inspect repository state.
2. Inspect recent commit message style.
3. Summarize the current change scope.
4. Draft one concise commit message that matches local history.
5. Stage and commit with non-interactive commands.
6. Verify and report result.
